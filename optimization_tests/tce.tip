// This test is designed to evaluate Tail Call Elimination (TCE).
// The function `tailRecursiveSum` performs a simple tail-recursive operation.
// Without TCE, this function would cause a stack overflow with large `n`.
// With TCE, it should execute without stack overflow issues, even for large `n`.
