// This test is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Superword Level Parallelism (SLP) Vectorization.
// It involves two arrays, arr1 and arr2, which undergo element-wise multiplication and addition,
// storing their results in separate arrays, arr3 and arr4. The loop iterates over these arrays
// to perform these operations in a manner conducive to vectorization. This test aims to assess
// the vectorizer's capability to handle multiple vectorization opportunities simultaneously,
// such as different types of operations (multiplication and addition) and varying data patterns.
// The output statements provide a means to verify the correctness of the operation while also
// analyzing the performance impact of vectorization.
